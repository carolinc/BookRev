      <div class="collapsible-body"><p> Ever since creatures, that when looked upon cause the viewer to become violent and suicidal, arrived on Earth, humanity rapidly deteriorated.  Malorie has not looked outside in 5 years. Her two 4-year-old children have never seen the outside world. Malorie must venture out into the world, and maneuver a rowboat down the river into order to bring her children to a sanctuary she’s not even sure still exists. While blindfolded, Malorie has to trust her children's’ trained listening ability to protect and guide them through the ruined world</p></div>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><p> I usually try my best to stay away from Dystopian reads as they often depress me, but then Bird Box popped up on a Kindle Daily Deal --I decided to risk it. Sometimes these Dystopian books surprise you and leave you with a sense of hope, rather than the usual sense of doom.
          <p>
            We get Malorie’s point-of-view in two different time periods. The present time centers around Malorie and her kids taking a boat from their solitary home to a sanctuary 20 miles down the river. I loved the journey. It is not an epic fighting-adventure. Instead, the boat ride is slow, and danger is insidious. It sneaks up on you slowly as the only awareness you have is what you can hear. Just reading about their journey was stressful. I was waiting for anything to pop out and attack. The writing is beautiful in creating a precarious sense of calm.</p>
            <p>
              The past time period takes place from when Malorie discovers that she’s pregnant, to finding a home with a small group of humans (and one dog) surviving together, to surviving alone with her children. These parts
              were interesting in that they revealed how the world crumbled in a few short years. They also describe the
              creatures that caused everything. That was a refreshing aspect for me. The catalyst for Earth's disintegration
              was not some virus, illness, war, or climate change. The best way to explain, is that they are creatures or
              things that wander the Earth. They are somewhat intelligent, but not malevolent (as far as I can tell).
              I found myself annoyed with how doe-eyed and boring Past-Malorie was compared to her current personality.</p>
              <p>In those 4 long years she becomes demoralized, hard, and a true survivor. She calls her children “Boy” and “Girl”
                because she found that true names are a luxury she couldn't afford. It’s disheartening that if Malorie had gotten
                too attached to her children, she wouldn’t have been able to do what she needed to in order for them to survive.
                Instead, she trained them to listen and how to endure and persevere in the new world. I loved her transformation.
                I loved Boy and Girl too. They were phenomenal representations at how well humans can evolve and adapt to changes in the environment.
